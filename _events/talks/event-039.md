**Background:** Evaluation of the quality of research software is a
challenging and relevant issue, still not sufficiently addressed by the
scientific community.

**Methods:** Our contribution begins by defining, precisely but widely
enough, the notions of research software and of its authors followed by
a study of the evaluation issues, as the basis for the proposition of a
sound assessment protocol: the CDUR procedure.

**Results:** CDUR comprises four steps introduced as follows: Citation, to
deal with correct RS identification, Dissemination, to measure good
dissemination practices, Use, devoted to the evaluation of usability
aspects, and Research, to assess the impact of the scientific work.

**Conclusions:** Some conclusions and recommendations are finally included.
The evaluation of research is the keystone to boost the evolution of the
Open Science policies and practices.  It is as well our belief that
research software evaluation is a fundamental step to induce better
research software practices and, thus, a step towards more efficient
science.
