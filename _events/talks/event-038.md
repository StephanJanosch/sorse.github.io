In October 2020 the UK government lost thousands of COVID test results because
they hit the limit of the maximum number of rows in an Excel file. This is but
one of many, many mistakes made all around the world because of spreadsheet
abuse. In 2012 the State Office of Education in Utah miscalculated its budget to
the tune of $25 million because of what State Superintendent Larry Shumway
called 'a faulty reference' in a spreadsheet. In 2011 the village of West
Baraboo in Wisconsin miscalculated how much their borrowing would cost by
$400,000 because a range being summed missed one important cell.

[Matt Parker](http://standupmaths.com/) is a long-time spreadsheet fan. His
stand-up routine about spreadsheets has over 2.5 million views on YouTube. But
he has also investigated the incredible ways they can go wrong for his
best-selling book Humble Pi. In this session Matt will look at some of the top
#VALUE! greatest spreadsheet mistakes as well as other times mishandling data
and maths has led to disaster.

**Come armed with your own spreadsheet horror stories to share!**
