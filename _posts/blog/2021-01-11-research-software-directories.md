## Introduction

The discussion session "[Research Software Directories: What, Why, and
How?](https://sorse.github.io/programme/discussions/event-013/)"
was held on September 16 during SORSE, an International Series of Online
Research Software Events. As presenters, we each shared efforts to
develop and maintain software directories: catalogues to showcase the
software outputs of an institution or community. The directories
presented were:

-   The [Research Software
    Directory](https://www.research-software.nl/) developed by
    the Netherlands eScience Center
    ([GitHub](https://github.com/research-software-directory/research-software-directory))
-   Imperial College London's [Research Software
    Directory](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/research-software-directory/)
    ([GitHub](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/research-software-directory))
-   The [Research Software
    Encyclopedia](https://rseng.github.io/rseng/)
-   [GitHub Search](https://vsoch.github.io/2020/github-search/)
    as a template for an individual or institution

Each of the above offered several advantages and disadvantages, or were
scoped for particular use cases. For example, research-software.nl
provides a robust application for serving detailed metrics and metadata
for software, however it requires more manual entry. The Research
Software Encyclopedia is automated and does not require hosting, but it
lacks the same level of metadata. The Imperial College London and GitHub
Search research software directories offer much quicker to deploy
solutions, but might be too simple for some use cases. The directories
are discussed in detail in the following sections. In addition to this
set, we suggest the reader take a look at the [Awesome Registries
list](https://bit.ly/awesome-registries) to find additional
examples.

### How many participants use software directories?

We were quite surprised at the results of asking attendees the extent to
which they have contributed or used software directories. For a total of
27 participants, 43% have used a directory for a relevant project, 27%
have submitted software to a directory, and 58% indicated neither of the
above.

## Presentations

### The Research Software Directory by Netherlands eScience Center

Slides available from Zenodo: [doi:
10.5281/zenodo.4034290](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4034290)

YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/Rky9OWSzYb0?t=200) (starting
3:20)

Jurriaan\'s presentation started off by explaining why the Netherlands
eScience Center had a need for what eventually became the Research
Software Directory. Primary reasons were that as the Netherlands
eScience Center grew beyond say, 20 or so engineers, tracking what
software was available in-house really became too difficult a problem to
do ad-hoc, despite the fact that all of their repositories are publicly
accessible on GitHub. Secondly, the eScience Center strives to be as
open as possible, and they thought it was important to be able to show
the outside world where the taxpayer\'s money had gone. Lastly, the
eScience Center has a continuous need to keep track of various metrics,
both for reporting to their funders
([SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en) and
[NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en)), but also for helping management
make informed business decisions.

Jurriaan then demonstrated the eScience Center\'s
[instance](https://research-software.nl) of the Research Software
Directory. While walking the viewers through the design, he explained
how the product pages\' design was helping site visitors on their way
towards adoption of the software presented on the product page.

When designing the Research Software Directory, specific attention was
paid to how an instance is filled with data, how this data is curated,
and how to do this in a way that can be sustained over time. To this
end, the Research Software Directory harvests much of its information
automatically, for example using APIs to GitHub (code development
platform), Zenodo (archiving service), and Zotero (reference manager).
This setup allows engineers employed by the Netherlands eScience Center
to stay mostly in their comfort zone (i.e. GitHub). They just need to
make sure to follow best practices such as having publicly accessible
repositories, making releases on Zenodo using the [automated
integration](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/),
and including software citation metadata
([CFF](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)) in their
repositories. Given that they already do much of that anyway, making an
entry in the Research Software Directory can be achieved in a few clicks
via the Admin interface that the Research Software Directory provides.

The Research Software Directory has proven to be a great resource for
managing the organization, for providing funders with relevant metrics,
and for increasing the visibility of tools. Despite these upsides, of
course there are some downsides as well, for example it has proven
difficult to carve out enough time to curate prose on the product pages,
leading to text snippets that are sometimes too difficult to read for
visitors not yet familiar with the software that the product page
presents. A second problem is maintenance of the Research Software
Directory software itself: the software stack includes more than 40
techniques, methods, and tools, in various languages and using a variety
of frameworks. It has proven difficult to find developers that are
familiar enough with all of these to be effective at maintaining the
site. While this has not led to any significant downtime in the 3 years
research-software.nl has been running, eScience Center intends to start
reducing the software stack in the very near future. Furthermore, they
are investigating whether it\'s feasible to provide Research Software
Directories as a service.

### The Research Software Directory by Imperial College London

Slides available from Zenodo:

Mark Woodbridge demonstrated Imperial College's [Research Software
Directory](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/research-software-directory/),
explaining how it was developed to present a manually curated list of
GitHub and GitLab repositories - motivated by a desire to rapidly
catalogue and demonstrate the breadth of software developed at Imperial.
It is also intended to encourage collaboration by assisting researchers
to identify existing expertise and projects at Imperial.

The chosen approach has resulted in a system which is easy to maintain -
both in operational complexity and in adding entries to the directory
(even if the latter does depend on some familiarity with git and GitHub
i.e. making a commit and pull request). This simplicity comes at a
price: it depends on Algolia (a freemium service), has limited features,
and is not easy to customise. It also relies on manual curation and
repository metadata: due to limited bandwidth and lack of incentives,
developers rarely submit or annotate software themselves. Finally, it
lacks the polish and level of detail that you might expect of a
public-facing showcase.

The system has however achieved its aims in effectively showcasing
research software and developers at Imperial, and has provided a set of
metadata enabling the identification of preferred languages to
fast-growing fields of research. A suite of standalone utility scripts
ensures that the contact details and project web pages remain
up-to-date, and that new repositories by known developers are added to
the directory in a timely manner.

### The Research Software Encyclopedia

The Research Software Encyclopedia (RSEPedia) is a community-driven,
open source directory that provides a means to communicate about
software. It consists of three components - a set of criteria and
taxonomy items used to describe or otherwise communicate about software
categorization preferences, a database, and a command line client to
interact with those components. The criteria and taxonomy items are
maintained in their own GitHub repository,
[https://github.com/rseng/rseng](https://github.com/rseng/rseng),
and render to [an interface](https://rseng.github.io/rseng/) to
allow for exploration and visualization. Importantly, the site for these
items hosts a weekly software showcase, allowing the community to learn
more about open source libraries that might be useful for their work.
The terms are also served programmatically to a RESTful application
programming interface (API) that makes them readily available for the
RSEPedia software, which is also provided on GitHub
([https://github.com/rseng/rse](https://github.com/rseng/rse)).
Using the software, an individual or institution is empowered to easily
generate a database and interface for a set of software they care about.
They can inspect, add, search, or otherwise interact with metadata.
While relational databases can be created, the community maintained
database is a flat file database hosted on GitHub
([https://rseng.github.io/software](https://rseng.github.io/software))
that allows an interested contributor to browse, and annotate software
with criteria and taxonomy items in an online interface. Annotation only
takes a few clicks, and the process to make changes and update the
database is fully automated via GitHub actions. Annotation in bulk is
also easy to do locally after cloning the software repository, starting
the annotation interface, and opening a pull request with changes.
Importantly, although annotation can help to share ideas about software,
it is not required to make the RSEPedia useful. By way of being able to
communicate about software via asking questions, and by way of the
software showcase, the RSEPedia can be successful for your needs if you
just need a way to describe what you are looking for (e.g., for a grant
or journal) or just want to share your set of software to be easily
searchable.

[GitHub Search](https://vsoch.github.io/search) is a derivation
of the Research Software Directory by Imperial College London, but it
removes the Algolia dependency, and derives software repositories
directly from the GitHub API list of repositories for an organization
directly on GitHub pages. This means that deployment is easy, coming
down to simply creating the repository with a GitHub action to build it
at some frequency to update the pages.

## Discussions

After the presentations, attendees were divided over three groups for a
20-minute discussion session. All three groups saw lively discussions
and discussed a plethora of relevant subjects, a selection of which is
included below.

### How do software directories interact with high performance computing (HPC)?

With several attendees that work as administrators for HPC, the question
quickly came up about the relationship between software directories and
HPC centers. Indeed, these centers typically maintain a large catalog of
software for a user base, and it could be beneficial to link this
software catalog or strategy to maintain it with a software directory.
For example, if you are familiar with
[spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) or
[easybuild](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild) you could
imagine having integration to use a software directory to look up
metadata, or generate user-friendly documentation pages. The pages might
have install instructions, examples, and optimization hints for
different architectures.

[Guix-HPC](https://hpc.guix.info/) is a package manager for a
variety of software that is developed to allow reproducible HPC
environments. It may interact with existing instances of Research
Software Directories.

### Curation policies

The main concern related to the "curation" of software directories were
criteria for inclusion. A lively discussion related to the definition of
"research software", particularly in relation to scale and licensing. In
the broadest sense there was agreement in principle that it could refer
to any tool or library used to produce scientific results.

In terms of scale, attendees working in life sciences research
emphasized that research software in their context could be a standalone
script, and software directories should therefore "scale-down"
appropriately. Scripts of this type may be less substantial but their
quality could well be assessed similarly to more prototypical projects
in terms of documentation, design for re-use and version control.

Licensing was a more challenging topic - an argument was made for
directories enabling users to find *any* tool that might accelerate
research, including commercial software - as long as an appropriate
licence was available.

In broader terms, there was consensus that curators should avoid making
assumptions about software applicability and relevance, even if they do
have domain knowledge. More important than strict policies is effective
annotation and filters so that users can apply their own criteria when
searching for relevant software.

### Searching for software

Searching for software presents its own challenges as an RSD only
presents local results and many other platforms would need to be
consulted for an exhaustive overview of relevant packages. Here, some
registry lists prove to be helpful, for example [Awesome Research
Software Registries](https://bit.ly/awesome-registries).

### The purpose and minimum features of Research Software Directories

Participants identified discoverability as a major issue in relation to
research software, particularly for domain specialists (i.e. end-users).
This led to the following features being considered of primary
importance:

-   Metadata clearly explaining the purpose and value of individual
    software tools in non-technical terms. The community is currently
    working on metadata standards like
    [CFF](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.m2NU20) or
    [CodeMeta](http://codemeta.github.io/).
-   Contact details for the authors of the software in case further
    advice or support is required
-   Installation and getting started instructions
-   Guidance on how to cite the software
-   Licensing terms. This was discussed not only in relation to terms of
    use but also, for non-free software, ensuring cost-efficiencies by
    avoiding unilateral purchasing decisions and promoting the use or
    procurement of shared/group licences.

Many other features may benefit researchers, for example, linking from
an RSD entry to its accompanying paper and data, as suggested in
\"[*Generalist Repository Comparison
Chart*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3946719)\" or listing
received software citations, as implemented in
[swMATH](https://www.swmath.org).

### Organization-based registry vs community-based registry

Some registries out there are scoped to serve an organization, whereas
other registries like [ascl.net](https://ascl.net) or
[bio.tools](https://bio.tools) aim to serve an entire research
community. An advantage of the latter is increased traffic to the
registry, and real benefits for users to browse the registry to see if
somebody else in the community already created a solution. However,
because the social structure across the community is quite loose, it
will be more difficult to keep people involved, to discover new tools
that could be added to the registry, and to make sure that the language
used on the registry\'s pages is understandable by everyone in the
community. Furthermore, governance of the instance will be more
difficult. For example, within the community there may exist different
opinions on what metadata should be kept, and weighing these opinions
will be more difficult in a larger community than a small one.

In contrast, organizational registries are more easy to run and govern
\-- discovering tools that could be added is (or used to be) a matter of
hanging out at the coffee machine and asking your colleague what they
are working on right now. Helping your colleague enter their data, and
making sure they do it correctly, is easier as well, and some good
old-fashioned peer pressure can be applied if needed. Funding policies
currently do not mandate the publication of research software, as
Horizon 2020 required for research data (if possible).

## Further resources

- A categorization by type of information or content in the registry
  is provided by \"[*Research Software Discovery: Challenges, Risks
  and Opportunities*](https://zenodo.org/record/1310046)\".
- [Re3Data](https://www.re3data.org/) provides an overview of
  registries, including both research software and data
- The [Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org)
  provides an overview of Research Organizations

## Recommendations and Next Steps

By discussing topics of curation, federation, technology and
sustainability of research software directories with a wider audience,
this discussion section hoped to not only promote the benefits of such
directories and encourage their deployment, but also to identify issues
and gather ideas to address them. From discussion above, it's clear that
there are interesting projects and updates to existing directories that
might be pursued.
