Are you already looking forward to the festive break for some relaxation? Yes,
so are we! But just before you close your computer down for possibly the last
time in 2020, join us for a lighthearted look at _When Spreadsheets Attack!_
with the hilarious, well-known standup comedian and mathematician, [Matt
Parker](http://standupmaths.com/), followed by some tales from the
community. See some of Matt's hilarious work on
[YouTube](http://youtube.com/standupmaths).

What a way to start the holidays with an hour of standup comedy!

So get yourself a well-deserved…

- (choose as appropriate) glass of vin chaud, mulled wine, Bisschopswijn, Lidl’s
  finest gluhwein or maybe you fancy a mug of eggnog or a spiced pumpkin latte
  or a cold cold beer (southern hemisphere looking at you)

  and to go with it…

- (choose as appropriate) a mince pie, a piece of stollen or a chocolate covered
  spiced lebkuchen, a few Speculaas, an Oliebollen or a leftover slice of
  pumpkin pie.

Join us at the SORSE Christmas event, kindly funded by the Society of Research
Software Engineering. The SORSE team will be bringing our Christmas drink and
snack of choice so you might as well too!

Registration is now open and the Zoom link will be sent out by email at least
one hour before the start. The event will last approx. 2 hours.

**Get involved! More tales from the community needed! Can you talk to one or more of these questions below?**

Have you transitioned a researcher from spreadsheets to something more
substantial? Do you have a spreadsheet horror story? Can you tell us your
experience of when a researcher crossed that boundary? How did you let them
know where that boundary was and how did you help them? How did you choose what
to use and how did you persuade the researcher to give it a go? Email Claire
to volunteer yourself or nominate a colleague via [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
